This is a sample repo
---------------------

This repo is to be used as an example for `Mariatta`_'s
`PyCon US 2021`_ tutorial: `Writing Documentation with Sphinx and reStructuredText`_

It has a made-up Python module called ``my_aquarium``. This module will
be used in the tutorial to show how to add the Sphinx documentation project to it.

Python version compatibility: 3.6+ and up, because of f-strings.
